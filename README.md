# rainbow-with-RGB-LED
using LEDs secure paper text, a hardware project
# the code require a hardware to realize it, as shown in follows.
1.NCL30160 chip 
2.Responsive components such as inductance and diode. 
3.Rsense pin with a 1/4 Î© for 800mA output. Change the resistance for virous output current. Iled=200mV/Rsense.
4.VIN with a 25uF capacitance.
5.VCC with a 10nF.
6.ROT = 100K
7.47uH inductance
8.cree LED with mix 1.2A current.
if you interest this, please don't hesitate and sent email to me:1024905667@qq.com. i have some remaining PCB if you want.
